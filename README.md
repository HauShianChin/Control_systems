# Control_systems

projects and assignment for the Control Systems and Advanced Control Systems Engineering courses (ECEN315 and EEEN415)

## ECEN315

The projects demonstrates the implementation of an open loop system and a closed loop system.

The assignments demonstrates my understanding of s planes, conversion between equations and block diagrams, phase and gain of a bode plot, transfer functions, and root locus. Additionally, these assignment observe the anomalies associated with closed loop systems.

## EEEN415

Demonstrates an understandign of modern control techniques in shaping the behaviour of complex systems having multiple inputs and outputs (MIMO), in both discrete and continuous time. Optimal control (LQR) and estimation (the Kalman filter) are introduced. Concentrates on linear and linearised systems, but some introductory nonlinear systems is presented, including applications to robot control.
