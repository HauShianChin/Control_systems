# Control_systems

projects and assignment for the Control Systems course (ECEN315)

The projects demonstrates the implementation of an open loop system and a closed loop system.

The assignments demonstrates my understanding of s planes, conversion between equations and block diagrams, phase and gain of a bode plot, transfer functions, and root locus. Additionally, these assignment observe the anomalies associated with closed loop systems.
